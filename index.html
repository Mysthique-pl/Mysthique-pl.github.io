                I'm pleased to welcome You here. Let me tell You a little story about me...
                I'm addicted to learning, I really do have a need for searching informations about many different
                things that I hear or read about in everyday life.
                And I'm driven by the achievements, by getting better at something or making things simpler and
                easier.
                <br>Couple months ago I've decided to try myself as a programmer. As I'm also an amateur
                photographer so I've thought "let's do myself a website from scratch".
                This is how I've started learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                <br>Firstly, I've done some courses for beginners, to study the basic rules. But I believie that the
                best way to really learn something is by making it,
                practise over the theory, so I've been looking for the simplest projects ideas I could do to force
                myself to expand my abilities.
                Here are some of them:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Mysthique-pl/calculator" target="blank">Calculator - because every
                        newbie must do one</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Mysthique-pl/calendar" target="blank">Calendar - you can save some
                        events in it</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Mysthique-pl/shoppinglist" target="blank">Shopping list - simple but
                        useful</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Mysthique-pl/mg-hangman" target="blank">Hangman - let's have some
                        fun</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the meantime, I've made 3 versions of my website. First, that was totally basic. Second one, in
                which I've tried using bootstrap library.
                It looked fine but I haven't liked restyling it so I've made third one, all from scratch like I've
                wanted it from the beginning. You can check it out <a href="http://mysthique.pl"
