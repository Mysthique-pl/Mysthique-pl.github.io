    <p>Hi! My name is Monika. I'm pleased to welcome You here. Let me tell You a little story about me...
        I'm addicted to learning, I really do have a need for searching informations about many different things that I hear or read about in everyday life. 
        And I'm driven by the achievements, by getting better at something or making things simpler and easier.
        <br>Couple months ago I've decided to try myself as a programmer. As I'm also an amateur photographer so I've thought "let's do myself a website from scratch". 
        This is how I've started learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
        <br>Firstly, I've done some courses for beginners, to study the basic rules. But I believie that the best way to really learn something is by making it,
        practise over the theory, so I've been looking for the simplest projects ideas I could do to force myself to expand my abilities. 
        Here are some of them:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="">Calculator - because every newbie must do one</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Calendar - you can save some events in it</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Shopping list - simple but useful</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Hangman - let's have some fun</a></li>
        </ul>
        In the meantime, I've made 3 versions of my website. First, that was totally basic. Second one, in which I've tried using bootstrap library. 
        It looked fine but I haven't liked restyling it so I've made third one, all from scratch like I've wanted it from the beginning. You can check it out <a href="http://mysthique.pl" target="blank">here</a>.
